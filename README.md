# Random-Signals-and-Noise---Class-exercises

This repository contains nine MATLAB scripts related to the "Random Signals and Noise" course. 
Each script explores different concepts and techniques related to random signals and noise. 
Here's a brief summary of each script:

"rs_1.m":

Generates random uniform and normal distributions with 1000 data points.
Plots histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for both distributions.

"rs_2.m":

Generates a pseudorandom sequence using a linear congruential generator.
Transforms the sequence into a normal distribution using a Box-Muller transform.
Plots a histogram of the transformed values.

"rs_3.m":

Implements a linear congruential generator to produce pseudorandom numbers.
Transforms the generated numbers into a normal distribution.
Plots histograms for both the transformed values and their squares.

"rs_4.m":

Generates two sets of normally distributed random values (x1 and x2).
Creates a 2D histogram to visualize the joint distribution of x1 and x2.

"rs_5.m":

Generates pseudorandom numbers and uses the Box-Muller transform to create two sets of normally distributed values.
Plots a 2D histogram and two separate histograms for the generated values.

"rs_6.m":

Simulates a Poisson process and generates a set of values.
Computes the sum of normally distributed random variables for each Poisson realization.
Plots a histogram of the resulting sums.

"rs_7.m":

Simulates a signal with additive Gaussian noise.
Applies two different signal optimizers (tanh and fractional) to estimate the original signal.
Plots the original signal, noisy signal, and optimized signals, along with histograms.

"rs_8.m":

Generates random samples from a uniform distribution.
Computes sample means and applies a transformation to them.
Plots the distribution of transformed sample means.

"rs_9.m":

Generates a random signal with a random angular frequency and phase.
Calculates the average of the signal.
Computes the unbiased cross-correlation of the signal.
Plots the cross-correlation.

These MATLAB scripts serve as practical exercises to gain hands-on experience with random signals, noise, and various statistical concepts introduced in the course.
Each assignment explores different aspects of random signal processing and provides a deeper understanding of the topic.
